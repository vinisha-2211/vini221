<p>blueberries are known for their disease-fighting properties. What’s more, they’re
accessible year-round, making them an excellent addition to your diet.

With more attention on nutrition and skin health, many people wonder how blueberries may
help their skin stay youthful and healthy.<br>
<b>1. Fight premature aging</b><br>

Blueberries are high in antioxidants, which are natural compounds that help fight cell-
damaging free radicals. In particular, they’re high in plant compounds known as

anthocyanins, which have strong antioxidant properties and give blueberries their natural
purple-blue hue <br>
a diet high in antioxidants, such as those found in blueberries, is associated with fewer signs
of aging and better skin quality due to their ability to scavenge free radicals in the skin and
promote healing
Along with other antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, eating blueberries can increase your
total antioxidant intake to help reduce premature aging<br>
<b>2. Improve circulation</b><br>
A diet high in blueberries is associated with better heart health and circulation, which is
important for skin health
Your heart pumps blood throughout your body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells, as
well as to remove waste from them.

Your skin is exposed to the external environment, which typically involves UV rays,
pollution, cuts, and bruises, and it needs nutrients and oxygen to heal and repair
Eating 1 cup (148 grams) of blueberries per day can help improve your body’s ability to send
nutrients and oxygen to your skin and other cells, allowing for quicker and more efficient cell
turnover, and ultimately, healthier skin <br>
