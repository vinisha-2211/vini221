Kale is not a new vegetable, but you may have just started hearing more about it.
It’s popular in northern Europe and now throughout the U.S. During the Middle Ages, kale
was planted and used to feed humans and livestock.
History books state that Thomas Jefferson experimented with several varieties of kale at his
Monticello estate in the early 1800s.<br>

The popularity of kale has skyrocketed in our country over the last four to five years.
It has become available at not only farmer’s markets but local grocery stores, as well.
You can purchase it in fresh bunches or prerinsed and trimmed in bags.
Local gardeners are also planting kale for their own use on the dinner table.<br>
<h2>NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS</h2>

Kale is a nutrition superstar due to the amounts of vitamins A, K, B6 and C, calcium,
potassium, copper and manganese it contains. One cup of raw kale has just 33 calories and
only 7 grams of carbohydrate. So, it’s a very diabetes-friendly/weight-friendly vegetable.
Kale is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family along with cauliflower, Brussels
sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, collard greens, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips and bok choy. These
vegetables offer health benefits, including potentially reducing the risk of various types of
cancer. The only people who may need to avoid or limit kale intake are those that form
oxalate containing kidney stones or take the blood thinner Coumadin/warfarin. Be sure to
check with your doctor or dietitian if you have questions.

<h2>USES FOR KALE</h2>

Kale holds its texture well in cooking, and it can be steamed, stir fried, roasted, or eaten raw.

You can turn it into smoothies, kale chips, wilt it into soup, mash it with potatoes or turn it
into pesto.
Always remove the middle rib as it tends to be overly tough and fibrous and imparts a more
bitter taste when eaten. Remove the rib by hand or with kitchen shears.

Kale is a cool-weather and frost-resistant plant and is available in Minnesota January through
June and October through December.

How do you pick out the best bunch of kale? Avoid wilted or browning leaves.
The leaves and stalks should be dark green with small- to medium-sized leaves free of any
yellowing. You want it to be firm and dry instead of wilted and mushy.

Kale holds up for up to five days if loosely wrapped in the refrigerator. If it is kept longer
than this the leaves tend to toughen.<br>
