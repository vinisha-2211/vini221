<p>Broccoli is a branched, green vegetable with either purple or more commonly green
flower buds. It belongs to the cruciferous family, along with cauliflower, cabbage and kale
and it can be eaten raw or cooked,<br>
<h2>Nutritional benefits of broccoli</h2>
There have been many health claims over the years about broccoli and whether it could be
labelled a ‘superfood’ or not, but its nutrient-rich profile does offer some real health benefits.

Broccoli is a good source of fibre and protein, and contains iron, potassium, calcium,
selenium and magnesium as well as the vitamins A, C, E, K and a good array of B vitamins
including folic acid.
A study by Nutrition Research found that consuming steamed broccoli regularly lowers the
risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing the total amount of cholesterol in the body.
Another study in the US also found that increasing vegetables in the diet, especially
cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, could reduce the risk of heart disease.
Vitamin K is an essential nutrient that is needed for blood clotting, and may play an important
role in keeping our bones healthy and strong. Whilst more research is needed, there has been
consistent evidence that vitamin K can improve bone health in general as well as increasing
bone mineral density and reducing fracture rates in those with osteoporosis.

Adults need 1 mcg of vitamin K per kilogram of body weight, which means a 75kg adult
would need 75mcg of vitamin K a day. Just 100g steamed broccoli provides 145mcg of
vitamin K, so this nutrient can be easily achieved through diet alone.<br>
While there are no single ‘superfoods’ that can prevent cancer and certain risk factors for
cancer are unrelated to diet, there is evidence that eating a healthy diet can reduce the risk of
cancer. A key component of broccoli is a phytochemical known as sulforaphane, which also
gives broccoli a slight bitter taste. Studies have shown that sulforaphane may play a part in
enhancing detoxification of airborne toxins, such as cigarette smoke, and could help reduce
the risk of certain cancers. Further research has suggested that broccoli may have anti-cancer
properties and could reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

Broccoli sprouts are, in fact, a more concentrated source of these cancer-fighting compounds.
These can easily be sprouted from seed on your windowsill, just like growing cress.<br>
A 2008 report by the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry found that boiling and
steaming was best for preserving broccoli’s antioxidant status, but that cooking can destroy
vitamin C. Another piece of research, however, demonstrated that raw broccoli was best
when it comes to preserving the levels of sulforaphane. In short, whether you eat broccoli raw
or cooked, it is a valuable addition to a balanced diet.<br>
