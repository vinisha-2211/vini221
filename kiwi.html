<p>The kiwi – shortened from its full name, the kiwifruit – is actually a large berry that
grows on a species of woody vine in the genus Actinidia. Kiwis have been famously
cultivated in New Zealand, but this bold berry actually originated in eastern China. <br>
Kiwis are high in Vitamin C and dietary fiber and provide a variety of health benefits. This
tart fruit can support heart health, digestive health, and immunity. The kiwi is a healthy
choice of fruit and is rich with vitamins and antioxidants. Its tart flavor, pleasing texture, and
low calorie count make it a delicious and healthy option for snacking, sides, or a unique
dessert.<br>
<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
The vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants can provide essential health benefits. The flesh is rich
with vitamins that stimulate immunity and reduce the risk of disease.

The soluble dietary fiber found in kiwis can help stimulate regular and healthy digestion.
Kiwis can provide other health benefits like:

<h2>Immunity</h2>

Kiwi contains abundant amounts of Vitamin C, which stimulates the body’s immune
response. In fact, the kiwifruit contains roughly 230% of the daily recommended intake of
Vitamin C. This bold fruit provides a burst of immune-boosting nutrients in every bite.

Kiwis are also rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants help to eliminate free radicals within the
body and reduce oxidative stress. Ultimately, this may protect the body from inflammation
and disease.<br>

<h2>Heart Health </h2>

The kiwifruit possesses properties that lower blood pressure.
By helping to maintain a healthy blood pressure and providing a boost of Vitamin C, the
kiwifruit can reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease.

Beyond this, kiwi also contains a high level of dietary fiber.
Fiber can reduce risk factors for heart disease by lowering LDL or bad cholesterol.
A surplus of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a hardening of the arteries
within the heart.<br>

<h2>Digestive Health</h2>

Both in its tough skin and flesh, the kiwifruit contains high amounts of dietary fiber.
Fiber can help reduce constipation and a variety of other gastrointestinal issues and
discomfort.<br>

<h2>Treatment of Asthma</h2>

The abundance of Vitamin C in kiwis has been linked to the reduction of wheezing symptoms
in some asthma patients.
This is especially true of children, who seem to benefit the most from the consumption of
kiwis.<br>

<h2>Ocular Health</h2>

When consumed with other healthy vitamin and mineral-rich fruits and vegetables, the high
levels of antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids found in the kiwifruit may aid in preventing
eye disease and promote overall ocular health. <br>
