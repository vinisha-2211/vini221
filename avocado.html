<p>Avocados are a stone fruit with a creamy texture that grow in warm climates. Their
potential health benefits include improving digestion, decreasing risk of depression, and
protection against cancer.
Also known as an alligator pear or butter fruit, the versatile avocado is the only fruit that
provides a substantial amount of healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Avocados are
a naturally nutrient-dense food and contain nearly 20 vitamins and minerals.
Eating a diet that contains plenty of fruits and vegetables of all kinds has long been associated
with a reduced risk of many lifestyle-related health conditions.
Numerous studies have found that a predominantly plant-based diet that includes foods such
as avocados can help to decrease the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and overall
mortality while promoting a healthy complexion and hair, increased energy, and overall lower
weight.<br>
<b>1.Avocados are nutrient rich</b><br>
Avocados are a great source of vitamins C, E, K, and B-6, as well as riboflavin, niacin, folate,
pantothenic acid, magnesium, and potassium. They also provide lutein, beta-carotene, and
omega-3 fatty acids.

Although most of the calories in an avocado come from fat, donâ€™t shy away! Avocados are
full of healthy, beneficial fats that help to keep you full and satiated. When you consume fat,
your brain receives a signal to turn off your appetite. Eating fat slows the breakdown of
carbohydrates, which helps to keep sugar levels in the blood stable.

Fat is essential for every single cell in the body. Eating healthy fats supports skin health,
enhances the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, and may even
help boost the immune system.<br>
<b>2. Healthy for the heart</b><br>
Avocados contain 25 milligrams per ounce of a natural plant sterol called beta-sitosterol.
Regular consumption of beta-sitosterol and other plant sterols has been seen to help maintain
healthy cholesterol levels.<br>

<b>3. Great for vision</b><br>
Avocados contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two phytochemicals that are especially concentrated
in the tissues in the eyes where they provide antioxidant protection to help minimize damage,
including from ultraviolet light.

As the monounsaturated fatty acids in avocados also support the absorption of other
beneficial fat-soluble antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, adding avocados to your diet may
help to reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.<br></p>
